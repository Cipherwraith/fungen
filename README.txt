Tip: glut doesn't seem to work well with ghci here, stick with ghc


* Updated for ghc 6.8/ghc 6.10 by Miloslav Raus, 2008

Sound support currently not present (originally working only under win32), aiming at multiplatform support through OpenAL.
(If you want a version with sound support, you can find it at FunGEn website: http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~haskell/fungen/download.html)

Tested under Win32 & Linux/Intel.

Known glitches: Flickering under linux (at least on my shitty laptop).
                Wierd pong paddle behavior under Win32.
