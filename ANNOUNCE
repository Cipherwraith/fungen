I'm pleased to announce the long-pending release of FunGEn 0.4!

FunGEn (Functional Game Engine) is a BSD-licensed, cross-platform,
OpenGL/GLUT-based 2D game engine.  With very few dependencies and
several example games, it's one of the easiest ways to get started
with game development in Haskell. FunGEn was created by Andre Furtado
in 2002 and I (Simon Michael, sm) have maintained it sporadically.
If you'd like to take it on, let's chat! (eg on #haskell-game).

New in 0.4:

* a new hakyll-based website, incorporating the old site

* input handlers now receive mouse position and modifier state
  (inspired by Pradeep Kumar).  See fungentest.hs for examples.

* more haddocks

Install: $ cabal install FunGEn
